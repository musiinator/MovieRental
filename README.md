# MovieRental

Here is a simple Python object-oriented project that simulates a video rental shop.
The project includes classes for movies, customers, and rentals.
The Rental class represents a rental transaction, linking a movie with the customer who rented it.
Those who use this toy application have at their disposal various commands on clients and movies,
but also some statistics about rentals such as who are the most loyal customers.
